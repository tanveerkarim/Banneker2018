    "As we discussed in class, the definition of a day is relative and depends on what you use as a reference point. There are broadly two types of days:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Solar Day**: Measuring day from noon to noon, i.e. when Sun is at the meridian. The mean solar day is defined to be 24hr and is used for everyday usage.\n",
    "  - **Sidereal Day**: Measuring day from transit of stars from midnight to midnight, i.e. when a reference star crosses the meridian. The mean sidereal day is roughly 23hr 56m 4.09s. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sidereal day and the solar day differs from each other by $\\approx 4$ minutes every solar day, we see that the sidereal time drifts apart from the solar time by 2 hours every month because \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\left( \\frac{4 \\text{minutes}}{1 \\text{ solar day}} \\right) \\cdot 30 \\text{ solar day} &= 120 \\text{ minutes}  \\\\\n",
    "    &= 2 \\text{ hr}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the two days are synchronised during the Vernal Equinox (VE), i.e. at noon on March 21st (or whichever date the VE is on depending on the year), the two days start out as 0. But as time progresses, the mean solar day keeps falling behind the sidereal day by 4 minutes every solar day which results in the aforementioned difference. We will now use these information to do a three-part exercise and construct our own sidereal time converter. Do not worry if you do not finish this today. We will come back to this on Day 3."
